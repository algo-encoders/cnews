                           started out as an algorithm and eventually became a statistical process that has been ported to Android and iOS to give consumers misinformation-proof news. This platform provides a misinformation-proof framework at fractions of the cost of major companies, like Facebook. Our algorithmic process does not need a dedicated staff so interpretations of policy do not bog you down in potential legal matters or public controversey. Our unique methodology further helps to strengthen information flows by reinforcing habits that do not compromise democratic values, allowing diversity to shine outright. Curated News is immune to changes in the information environment, as we couple our platform with information consumption tools to help assist and strengthen your habits. Imagine consuming better information so you can earn more money on average and faster so you can save time. Imagine developing skillsets that actually help in your work while increasing your overall productivity. Curated News is more than just a platform; it is the future of information consumption for consumers who want a competitive edge without massive subscriptions that balloon in costs. For limited overhead, we have scaled information quality and equitized it. What Facebook did for social networking and Twitter and Instagram did for exposure, we are doing for content consumption.

                                 News is the primary mechanism people use to drive their daily decisions. Information quality is of the utmost importance for those who want to make high quality decisions, including consumers who want to get quality information faster. There are currently no secure news aggregators that utilize the statistical methodology Curated News employs. Furthermore, there are no platforms that serve high quality information content while simultaneously producing democratic values.
